# htsget Compliance
The htsget Compliance Suite determines a web service's compliance with the 
[htsget API specification](http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/htsget.html) for serving large alignment and variant datasets. The
specification, developed by the
[Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://ga4gh.org), serves
to provide a standardized, interoperable API framework across different
institutions.
